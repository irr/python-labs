# A demonstration of how each thread has its own scheduler.
#
# Author: Richard Tew <richard.m.tew@gmail.com>
#
# This code was written to serve as an example of Stackless Python usage.
# Feel free to email me with any questions, comments, or suggestions for
# improvement.
#
# FURTHER DETAIL:
#
# This example starts some tasklets on the main thread, and starts a second
# thread as well, starting some tasklets on that.  You should be able to
# see that the scheduler on each thread is unrelated to the one on the
# other, which is why I need to start a ManageSleepingTasklets for each of
# them.
#
# POSSIBLE PROBLEMS:
#
#   If Stackless complains that "run() must be run from the main thread's
#   main tasklet", then you need to get a later version of Stackless.
#   This constraint was removed.

    _locals.sleepingTasklets.append((endTime, channel))

    # Block until we get sent an awakening notification.
